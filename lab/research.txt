Cyber Attacks:

The reason why Cyber Attacks occure can be due to outdated protocoles. 
For example, the Yahoo security breach. Yahoo used MD5 for some of their information, 
which is much more easily decipherable than more powerful protocoles like bcrypt.
Which is why it remains important,that as technology continues to become more powerful, that we are always constantly adapting and 
changing and adapting technology to match the advancments happening.
